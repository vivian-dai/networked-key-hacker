# networked-key-hacker

sends key requests over a network to control another peron's keyboard without physically being near

## Backstory

There's some 2 player games which require both players to be using the same keyboard. These games have been not possible to play with social distancing measures so I decided to create a way around that.

## TODO

- [ ] log keys on client end
- [ ] send client keys over to server
- [ ] use pyautogui or whatnot to have server "press" the keys
