# networked-key-hacker
sends key requests over a network to control another peron's keyboard without physically being near

## Backstory
There's some 2 player games which require both players to be using the same keyboard. These games have been not possible to play with social distancing measures so I decided to create a way around that. For whatever reason I ended up procrastinating on this for a few months and by the time I decided I should wrap up a bunch of my unfinished projects, I decided I could take this and attempt to create a proper Python project with this.

## TODO
- [ ] log keys on client end
- [ ] send client keys over to server
- [ ] use pyautogui or whatnot to have server "press" the keys
- [ ] Use mkdocs to make docs
- [ ] make graphic interface with pygame
- [ ] create an exe file with the graphical interface
- [ ] maybe use a more legit protocol
