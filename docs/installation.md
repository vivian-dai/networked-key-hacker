# Installation
Go to the same folder as [`requirements.txt`](../requirements.txt) and use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install everything mentioned. Alternatively you can run ['install.bat'](./../scripts/install.bat) on Windows or ['install.sh'](../scripts/install.sh) on UNIX systems.

## Usage
Have an instance of [`server.py`](./../key_hacker/server.py) running. If you and your friend are connected on the same network, you can connect to the device's IP on port 5000. If not, port forwarding is necessary.
